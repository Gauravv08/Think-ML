Hello everyone ,
We are a group of three students preparing a project for an Machine Learning Innovation Challenge.
# The problem statement that we are working on states that we have to explore building models to predict air quality index based on existing parameters like CO, Ozone, PM2.5. Analyze the impact of weather conditions on air quality in differentÂ regions.
Air pollution is a significant environmental issue affecting public health worldwide. Various pollutants, such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), and Particulate Matter (PM2.5), contribute to the deterioration of air quality. Understanding the relationship between these pollutants and weather conditions can help in predicting air quality and implementing effective mitigation strategies.
# Introduction to our Dataset 
The dataset was provided to us by the organising team it contains the mixture of both numeric and string values in it. It has total
